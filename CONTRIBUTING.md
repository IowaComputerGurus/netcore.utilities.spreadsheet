We want to welcome contributions from all interested parties to help continue to grow the collection of items within this library that help to promote proper enterprise development practices.  However, there are a few key notes to understand before you submit a contribution.

## Branching Strategy

We are using a simplified GitFlow structure for management of contributions.  All Pull Requests should be submitted to the Development branch, and once we are ready to create a production release the organizers will merge development into master for the release.

## Automated Build Verifications

Each submitted Pull Request will trigger an automated build, this build will execute all Unit Tests and a passing build is a requirement prior to the merging of any pull request.  If there are any questions on build errors you can reach us at opensource@iowacomputergurus.com for any clarification.

## Release Planning

We plan to release updates within 1 week of the receiveing the contributions in an effor to to limit the number of downstream updates required we might delay a release temporarily until a larger release makes sense.  If an urgent need exists, let us know and we can expedite.
